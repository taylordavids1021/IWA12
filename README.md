IWA_12.2: Challenge 1
# The following is a sample page from a library management system.

# Each specific bookâ€™s status should be indicated, as well as which actions users are able to perform on each book. You are required to make the following changes to the page by only editing the JavaScript (you are not allowed to change the HTML file directly). Unfortunately, the HTML is generated by the server, which also means that you will have to use the ID and class values the find the right elements in the DOM.

# PLEASE NOTE: No changes are to be made to the HTML file directly!

# Please ensure that the following works correctly:

# Enable/disable buttons based on the status/properties in the STATUS_MAP object.
# Buttons are only allowed to be black and grayscale (no colour is allowed).
# The colour of the status indicator text should correspond to the values in STATUS_MAP
